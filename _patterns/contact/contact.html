    <p>The person sketching at 2AM, that is probably me. I am always expanding my knowledge in the Graphic Design field. When I am in my zone, I cannot seem to put my pencil down. I am someone who does not give up.</p>
    <p>The good designs are simple because they are most memorable. I am excited to get into my design zone for you and how we can design something memorable for the industry. </p>
