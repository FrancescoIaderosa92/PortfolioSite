      <h2 class="giga">Final Product</h2>
      <p>The final product that was redesigned was nothing short of a success. This is my best piece in my portfolio.</p>

      <h2 class="giga">Design</h2>
      <p>I chose this design because it best reflected the owner's background. It is essentially paying homage to the owner's family heritage.</p>

    <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 island">
      <h2 class="giga">Colour Choice</h2>
      <p>I chose the colour white, because the client wanted black business cards. having a black business card is more unique, because there are not a lot of people that have one.</p>

    <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 island">
      <h2 class="giga">Typeface</h2>
      <p>I chose this typeface because it is sans serif and easy to see when the type is small.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 island">
      <h2 class="giga">Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The target audience for this rebrand was to appeal to everyone over the age of 18. Almost everyone needs to get their taxes done, so I made a design that was easy for everyone to see.</p>
