      <p>The final product that was redesigned was nothing short of a success. This is my best piece in my portfolio.</p>
      <p>When we were given the opportunity to redo a project, I was wanted to do something to promote the war museum here in Ottawa. Throughout the project, I wanted to create something that would memorialize the war vets as well as the fallen soldiers that were sacrificed so we could have our freedom. The project touched me very deeply because of the type of project it was.</p>
