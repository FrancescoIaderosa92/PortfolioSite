      <p>Growing up I was a huge fan of Stan Lee, when I heard about his passing, I knew I wanted to do something that would allow people to remember him. I came up with an event where all fans could go to remember him. There was not much of a sketch phase involved in this project, I knew what I wanted to do right from the start. He is a person I idolized and wanted to create some work to remember him.</p>
